# Instructions

## Introduction

This React frontend consumes the data coming from the backend Node server by sending the respective form inputs via fetch GET request and displays the results from that request. Also enables user clicking bookmarking and displays all bookmarked repositories.

## Install dependencies

To install all necessary dependencies run `npm install`

## Start Server

To start the server run `npm start`

You also need to start the Backend Node Server since this frontend is relying on the backend to make the requests to the GitHub API.
