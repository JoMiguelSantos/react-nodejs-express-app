# React-Node-Express App

This app was built as a fullstack app with an API on the backend which serves as a simplified GitHub v3 API, taking a limited number of specific search terms and returns an array with GitHub Repos which is then used by the Frontend, built with React, to display these Repos and allows you to Un/Bookmark the Repos of your choice and visit a page which has all bookmarked Repos.

It has no data persistance in the form of a Database or LocalStorage so the data will only stay in the Redux Store/Server for as long as they're on (and no reset).

You can find a README in both client and server that shows you how to make each other in Dev and give it a try locally
